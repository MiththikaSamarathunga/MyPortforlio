<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Mother</h3>
<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother!"><img src = "../assets/images/mother.jpg" height = '200' /></a>

<p>It was an amazing movie with some kind of mistery and phsycological effect.
    (It includes some scenes which can be disturbing for some people)</p>

<h3>Intesteller</h3>
<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)"><img src = "../assets/images/intesteller.jpg" height = '200' /></a>

<p>Mystery , sci-fi movie with more scientific background. The scientific people will love this for sure.</p>
<h3>Mama</h3>
<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_(2013_film)"><img src = "../assets/images/mama.jpg" height = '200' /></a>

<p>A horror movie which shows the love of a mother for some lost kids in the wood where the mother is 
    actually a spirit who lost her child by an accident. Great movie for horror lovers.</p>
